# Machine-Learning-in-Drought-Index-Forecasting
Machine learning models built for prediction for Temporal Hydrological Drought Index Forecasting.
A project where SVR, Random Forest and ANN models are used, along with implementation of feature ablation and hyperparameterization for each model. Calculated are values of R square, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for each model. The data has been divided into 3 parts, from the year 1900-2000 : Test data, year 2000-2010: Training data, and year 2010-2019: Validation data.
Batch normalisation has been applied to remove overfitting in ANN.
